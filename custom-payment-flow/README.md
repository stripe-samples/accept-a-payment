# Accept a payment with a custom form

This integration shows you how to accept payments with Stripe
[Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout).

Building a payment form UI from scratch is difficult -- input field
validation, error message handing, and localization are just a few things
to think about when designing a simple checkout flow.

We built [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) to do that
work for you so now you can focus on building the best storefront
experience for your customers.

Once your customer is ready to pay, use Stripe.js to redirect them to the
URL of your Stripe hosted payment page. 🥳

## How to run locally

Recommended approach is to install with the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install):

```sh
stripe samples create accept-a-payment
```

Then pick:

```sh
custom-payment-flow
```

This sample includes several different server implementations and several
different client implementations. The servers all implement the same routes and
the clients all work with the same server routes.

Pick a server:

- [dotnet](./server/dotnet)
- [go](./server/go)
- [java](./server/java)
- [node](./server/node)
- [node-typescript](./server/node-typescript)
- [php](./server/php)
- [python](./server/python)
- [ruby](./server/ruby)
- [php-slim](./server/php-slim)

Pick a client:

- [html](./client/html)
- [react-cra](./client/react-cra) (React with create-react-app)


**Installing and cloning manually**

If you do not want to use the Stripe CLI, you can manually clone and configure the sample yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment
```

Rename and move the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file into a file named
`.env` in the specific folder of the server language you want to use. For
example:

```
cp .env.example custom-payment-flow/server/node/.env
```

Example `.env` file:

```sh
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
STATIC_DIR=../../client/html
DOMAIN=http://localhost:4242
```

You will need a Stripe account in order to run the demo. Once you set up
your account, go to the Stripe [developer
dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys) to find your API
keys.

The other environment variables are configurable:

`STATIC_DIR` tells the server where to the client files are located and does not need to be modified unless you move the server files.

`DOMAIN` is the domain of your website, where Checkout will redirect back to after the customer completes the payment on the Checkout page.

**2. Follow the server instructions on how to run**

Pick the server language you want and follow the instructions in the server folder README on how to run.

For example, if you want to run the Node server:

```
cd server/node # there's a README in this folder with instructions
npm install
npm start
```

If you're running the react client, then the sample will run in the browser at
`localhost:3000` otherwise visit `localhost:4242`.


**4. [Optional] Run a webhook locally**

You can use the Stripe CLI to easily spin up a local webhook.

First [install the CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and [link your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#link-account).

```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

The CLI will print a webhook secret key to the console. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value in your `.env` file.

You should see events logged in the console where the CLI is running.

When you are ready to create a live webhook endpoint, follow our guide in the
docs on [configuring a webhook endpoint in the
dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/setup#configure-webhook-settings).
