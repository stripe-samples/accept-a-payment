An implementation with Flask.

You can [🎥 watch a video](https://youtu.be/Tgjwx-38Dic) to see how this server was implemented and [read the transcripts](./TRANSCRIPTS.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [Configured .env file](../README.md)

## How to run

1. Confirm `.env` configuration

Ensure the API keys are configured in `.env` in this directory. It should include the following keys:

```yaml
# Stripe API keys - see https://stripe.com/docs/development/quickstart#api-keys
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test...

# Required to verify signatures in the webhook handler.
# See README on how to use the Stripe CLI to test webhooks
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Path to front-end implementation. Note: PHP has it's own front end implementation.
STATIC_DIR=../../client/html
DOMAIN=http://localhost:4242
```


2. Create and activate a new virtual environment

**MacOS / Unix**

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```
python3 -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<summary>Optionally - Add Stripe Tax</summary>
Stripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT and GST with one line of code.
To enable Stripe Tax set up in the dashboard: [Docs - Set up Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up).

In ["server.py"](./server.py), set calcuateTax to true if you want Stripe to calculate tax for the transactions in this application.

```python
calcuateTax = False
```
